Example submission
============================
This folder contains a comma-separated text file and a parquet file to serve as sample submission files. These were generated with `generate-example-submission.R`. Please see these files for an example of how submissions should be formatted, particularly for new targets such as the optional sample trajectories. 

Data locations
============================

This folder contains a comma-separated text file `locations.csv` that 
contains the location name, FIPS code, and population for each valid forecast location. The file `locations_202324.csv` contains the same information for the previous 2023-2024 season, and `locations_202425.csv` contains the same information for the 2024-2025 season.

Note that national, state, and Puerto Rico population sizes are taken from the [U.S. Census Bureau 2024 Vintage population totals](https://www.census.gov/data/tables/time-series/demo/popest/2020s-state-total.html).
